<<-WELCOME

This is a straight up Ruby excercise used to both demonstrate the use of the Proof library as well as to explore some
design concepts

Some of the constraints for the excercise are as follows:

- Favour composition over monkey patching

- Enumerable (Limited to use of just the following methods)
  - each
  - sort
  - count
  - include?

- Array (Limited to use of just the following methods)
  - dup
  - <<

- lib/genres.rb and lib/studios.rb cannot be modified
  - You also cannot monkey patch these modules

WELCOME
